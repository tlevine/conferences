Recent policy changes have led to massive releases of government
data in the form of open data. Open data is typically released
on open data portals, using a standard technology like the
Socrata Open Data Portal software. A side effect of this is that
we now have rich data on the publishing and use of open data.

By conducting big data analyses about the relationships among
50,000 open datasets from 60 municipalities and organizations,
we have elucidated trends in the publishing and use of open
data. The talk will focus on these insights and their
practical relevance to people who use open data or who manage
disparate data within a large organization.

We'll also touch on some of the technology behind our analysis
system, including the management of varied metadata formats,
wrangling of a wide variety of datasets, and algorithmic
integration of datasets with poor metadata.

We'll focus on some technology-based approaches for discovering
open data that pertains to your business. We'll also discuss
some data quality best practices
help enforce that these practices are followed.
