Title: OpenPrism

Description:

  I quite like the surveillance lifestyle, and my concern is simply that it does not go far enough;
  governments and big companies keep my private information to itself rather than disseminating the
  data the other people who could make use of the data. Open data initiatives explore an alternative
  surveillance lifestyle with the public in mind. Information is allowed to flow freely

What will your proposed contribution add to this event?

What do you hope to get out of this experience?

  Being in a privileged position of not being noticably persecuted by any government, I am able to
  use my life as an experiment in extreme openness. I post information as openly as I conveniently
  can, and I am personally quite comforted by the knowledge that everyone is reading it. This allows
  people to recognize my accomplishments, build on my work, and take action if I suddenly got kidnapped. 

  I dream that one day we will have no concept of private information.
