How open data actually works: A data-driven study about the open data ecosystem

By conducting big data analyses about the relationships among 50,000 open datasets from 60 municipalities and organizations, we have elucidated patterns in the publishing and use of open data. Based on these findings, we have developed open-source tools to automate the discovery of open data that are relevant to your business.

You should attend this talk if you want to enrich existing datasets, if you already use open data, if you manage an open data initiative, or if you manage disparate proprietary datasets within a large organization. In the talk, you'll learn how you can use our findings and tools to advance your data-driven busines.
