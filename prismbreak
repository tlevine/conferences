Title: OpenPrism

Description:

  I quite like the surveillance lifestyle, and my concern is simply that it does not go far enough;
  a privileged elite of governments and big companies keep my private information to itself rather
  than disseminating it the common people, who are the very creators of this information. Surveillance
  in its conventional form exploints the work of the masses to create massive databases that maintain
  the power of the powerful.
  
  Open data initiatives explore an alternative surveillance lifestyle that rejects these class
  hierarchies, where information flows freely in a distributed fashion rather than stagnating in the
  vaults of central authorities.

What will your proposed contribution add to this event?

What do you hope to get out of this experience?

  Being in a privileged position of not being noticably persecuted by any government, I am able to
  use my life as an experiment in extreme openness. I post information as openly as I conveniently
  can, and I am personally quite comforted by the knowledge that everyone is reading it. This allows
  people to recognize my accomplishments, build on my work, and take action if I suddenly got kidnapped. 

  I dream that one day we will have no concept of private information.
