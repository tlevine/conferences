How open data actually works: A data-driven study about the open data ecosystem

Tags: open data,data variety,data wrangling,external data

Recent policy changes have led to massive releases of government
data in the form of open data. Open data is typically released
on open data portals, using a standard technology like the
Socrata Open Data Portal and the Comprehensive Knowledge Archive
Network. A side effect of this is that we now have rich data on
the publishing and use of open data.

By analyzing the relationships among 50,000 open datasets from
60 municipalities and organizations, we have elucidated trends in
the publishing and use of open data. The talk will focus on these
insights and their practical relevance to people who use open
data or who manage disparate data within a large organization.

We'll also touch how our data analysis architecture manages
inconsistent/undocumented metadata formats, wrangles a wide
variety of datasets, discovers dataset taxonomies, and
algorithmically integrates datasets with poor metadata.

Prerequisite: You should be somewhat familiar with web APIs, database schemas, and basic statistics. You won't need to know very much, but you might have trouble following if you haven't heard of these things before.
