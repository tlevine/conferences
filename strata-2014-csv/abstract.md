Music videos and gastronomification for big data analysis
====

Yesterday's technology can't handle today's big data. This is
true not only of our storage and computing tools, but also of
our visualization tools. Our visual bandwidth is simply not
enough to take in today's high-dimensional big data.

We present two new approaches for leveraging additional
human senses to make sense of big data: data music videos
and data gastronomification. We also present our open-source
tools for building and scaling systems for realtime data
analysis with data music videos and data gastronomification.

We'll discuss the theory behind these two data analysis methods,
and then we'll present case studies on how our tools are used to
enable business analytics and instill a data-driven culture.
