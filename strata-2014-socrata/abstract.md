By conducting big data analyses about the relationships among
50,000 open datasets from 60 municipalities and organizations,
we have elucidated patterns in the publishing and use of open
data. Based on these findings, we have developed open-source
tools to automate the discovery of open data that are relevant
to your business.

In the talk, you'll learn about our findings and their impact
on data-driven business. You should attend this talk if you want
to enrich existing datasets, if you already use open data, if
you manage an open data initiative, or if you manage disparate
proprietary datasets within a large organization.
