Recent policy changes have led to massive releases of government
data in the form of open data. Open data is typically released
on open data portals, using a standard technology like the
Socrata Open Data Portal software. A side effect of this is that
we now have rich data on the publishing and use of open data.

By conducting big data analyses about the relationships among
50,000 open datasets from 60 municipalities and organizations,
we have elucidated trends in the publishing and use of open
data. Based on these findings, we have developed open-source
tools to automate the discovery of open data that are relevant
to your business.

You should attend this talk if you use open data, you want to
use open data, you manage an open data initiative, or you manage
disparate proprietary data within a large organization. We'll 
discuss our findings and our tools.
