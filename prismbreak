Title: OpenPrism

Description:

  I quite like the surveillance lifestyle, and my concern is simply that it does not go far enough;
  a privileged elite of governments and big companies keep my private information to itself rather
  than disseminating it the common people, who are the very creators of this information. Surveillance
  in its conventional form exploints the work of the masses to create massive databases that maintain
  the power of the powerful.
  
  OpenPrism proposes an alternative surveillance lifestyle that rejects these class hierarchies, where
  information flows freely in a distributed fashion rather than stagnating in the vaults of central
  authorities, where the people have the means to surveil each other rather than being slave to a secret
  surveillance authority.

What will your proposed contribution add to this event?

  Being in a privileged position of not being noticably persecuted by any government, I am able to
  use my life as an experiment in extreme openness. I post information as openly as I conveniently
  can, and I am personally quite comforted by the knowledge that everyone is reading it. This allows
  people to recognize my accomplishments, build on my work, and take action if I suddenly got kidnapped. 

  Most people could not be as open as I am, and it will take years of gradual information-opening to
  reach such a culture of openness.

What do you hope to get out of this experience?

  I hope to impact people as I discuss in the previous answer or to identify faults in my dreams
  of widespread openness.
