Music videos and gastronomification for big data analysis
====

Yesterday's technology can't handle today's big data. This is
true not only of our storage and computing tools, but also of
our visualization tools. Our visual bandwidth is simply not
enough to take in today's high-dimensional big data.

We present two new approaches for leveraging additional
human senses to make sense of big data: data music videos
and data gastronomification. These multisensory approaches 
radically change the data analysis approach; they encourage
immersive and ambient data consumption, allowing us to ask
drastically different questions of our data.

We have developed some open-source tools for building and
scaling systems for realtime data analysis with data music
videos and data gastronomification. We'll discuss the theory
behind these two data analysis methods, and then we'll present
case studies on how our tools are used to enable business
analytics and instill a data-driven culture.
