Recent policy changes have led to massive releases of government
data in the form of open data. Open data is typically released
on open data portals, using a standard technology like the
Socrata Open Data Portal software. A side effect of this is that
we now have rich data on the publishing and use of open data.

By conducting big data analyses about the relationships among
50,000 open datasets from 60 municipalities and organizations,
we have elucidated trends in the publishing and use of open
data. In the talk, we'll discuss these insights and their
practical relevance to people who use open data or who manage
disparate data within a large organization.

We'll focus on some technology-based approaches for discovering
open data that pertains to your business. We'll also discuss
some common data quality issues and some technologies that can
help detect and fix these issues.
