Hi Joe,

We spoke after the last meeting. Here are two talks I could give. Does either seem interesting?

The music video talk is largely a disguised introduction to data visualization theory and to the wackier features of base R graphics. The open data talk would be more focused more on the findings than on the implementation, but it can function as a beginner's introduction to any of the features or libraries that I used; I'm thinking about knitr, reshape or just general R tricks (http://thomaslevine.com/!/r-spells-for-data-wizards).

I'd slightly prefer doing the open data talk rather than the music video talk.

Also, I'm going to be away from October 23 to November 10, so it would have to be after November 10. December would be good too.

## Music Videos in R
Data visualization is an important part of traditional data analysis processes. With the rise of big data, however, our use of vision is becoming a bottleneck in our interpretation of data. We need new approaches to help us make sense of the newly complex information.

Music videos are an effective way of presenting high-dimensional data inside of a web browser. By broadcasting to multiple human senses over time, music videos allow us to represent many variables at once.

R's vector drawing paradigm, powerful plotting functions, numerous graphics devices, and ddr library make it an ideal choice for the production of music videos. In this talk, I'll discuss how my band csv soundsystem (http://csvsoundsystem.com) makes music videos in R.

## Data about open data
Governments and other large organizations have recently been releasing and cataloging lots of their data so that the public may use it. I've been downloading these data and metadata about of these data, creating a meta-dataset of datasets. I've been studying this dataset about datasets in order to determine what open data are out there, who is using them, and how we can make open data more useful (http://thomaslevine.com/open-data/). In the talk, I'll discuss my findings and how I used R to get to them.
